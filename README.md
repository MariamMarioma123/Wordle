# Wordle
The project involves implementing a modified version of the game Wordle in Prolog, called Pro-Wordle. The game consists of two main phases: a knowledge base (KB) building phase and a gameplay phase. In the KB building phase, the player enters words and their categories, which are stored as facts in the KB. The player continues entering words until they enter "done." In the gameplay phase, the player selects a category and word length to guess. The game randomly selects a word from the KB and the player has a limited number of guesses to correctly guess the word. After each guess, the game provides feedback on the correct letters entered (regardless of position) and the correct letters in the correct positions. The player wins if they guess the word within the allowed number of guesses, and loses otherwise. The implementation requires several predicates such as is_category, categories, available_length, pick_word, correct_letters, correct_positions, build_kb, play, and main.
